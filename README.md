# E-commerce-data-analysis-Project

This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce dataset (Target) using SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle (Target Dataset). Through this analysis, I have solved various queries that range from basic to advanced, providing insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and other key metrics. This project demonstrates the application of both SQL and Python for data manipulation, querying, and analysis.

# Project Overview:
In this project, I explored and answered a series of queries to gain insights into the eCommerce business. The dataset consists of multiple files containing information on products, orders, customers, sellers, and payments. The analysis is divided into three main sections: Basic Queries, Intermediate Queries, and Advanced Queries.

# Basic Queries
1.List all unique cities where customers are located: Extracted a unique list of customer locations.
2.Count the number of orders placed in 2017: Calculated the total number of orders for the year 2017.
3.Find the total sales per category: Grouped product categories to compute total sales figures.
4.Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments: Derived the proportion of installment payments out of total orders.
5.Count the number of customers from each state: Grouped and counted customers based on their state location.

# Intermediate Queries
1.Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018: Analyzed order data month-wise to track ordering trends.
2.Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city: Calculated average products per order across cities.
3.Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category: Assessed revenue distribution across product categories.
4.Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased: Performed a correlation analysis to find relationships between product price and purchase frequency.
5.Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue: Ranked sellers based on their total revenue contributions.

# Advanced Queries
1.Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history: Implemented a moving average calculation to observe trends in customer spending over time.
2.Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year: Tracked cumulative sales growth on a monthly basis across multiple years.
3.Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales: Analyzed annual sales growth to measure performance improvement.
4.Calculate the retention rate of customers: Defined and computed the retention rate as the percentage of customers who made repeat purchases within 6 months of their first purchase.
5.Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year: Determined the top spenders annually, providing insights into key customers.

# Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
Python: Data analysis using libraries like pandas, numpy,matplotlib and seaborn for further 
        manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: A seamless environment for integrating SQL and Python.

# Key Takeaways
This project showcases:
The integration of SQL for efficient data querying and extraction of insights.
Use of Python to perform more complex calculations, visualizations, and analysis.
The ability to handle both basic and advanced analytical queries that provide deep insights into eCommerce operations such as customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance metrics.

Feel free to explore the notebooks to see detailed implementations of each query and the insights drawn from the data!
